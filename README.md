👋 Hi, I'm Kennedy Simon

🚀 About Me

I'm a growing software developer with hands-on experience in frontend, backend web development, and blockchain, actively moving beyond beginner level through consistent practice and real projects.

I’m not new to coding — I’ve built projects, worked with multiple languages, and understand core programming concepts. My focus is on strengthening fundamentals, writing cleaner code, and building scalable applications.

I learn best by building, refactoring, and improving real-world projects rather than relying only on tutorials.
